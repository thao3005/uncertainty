1. Pipeline:
converting 3D images into 2D slices -> train using predefined UNet model -> run inference (forward passes = 20) to get uncertainty map -> evaluate

2. Recent status:
- Code for preprocessing, model, training, mcdropout is ready
- The model is not trained properly (no improvements in dice score)
- Code not optimized yet (run very slowly - > 80 epochs in 24 hours)

3. Previous experiments:
- no change even when dropout rate = 0, 0.01, 0.1 or when decreasing the number of dropout layers
- Monai UNet and nnUNet not working
- Monai dice score, Torch dice score not working
